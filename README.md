# random-dnd-calculations

This is a repo set up to just contain any and all scripts I write to calculate things for Dungeons and Dragons.

## animate-objects-calculator

This simply calculates the number of animated objects that hit vs a target AC, and calculates the total damage dealt. Works for tiny, small, and medium objects. Large and Huge objects not included as they are dumb options for combat.
